  "problem": "An elderly woman was buying $NUM_ITEMS$ items at the store: a $COFFEE_PRICE$ bag of specialty coffee, a $MILK_PRICE$ carton of milk, and a $NEWSPAPER_PRICE$ newspaper. At the register, she paused to carefully check her purse for coupons, a process which took a total of $TOTAL_DELAY_SECONDS$ seconds. The polite but noticeably impatient cashier had a verbal tic, saying the word \"Ma'am\" to get her attention for every $TIC_INTERVAL_SECONDS$ seconds that she delayed. She eventually found two coupons—one for $COUPON_DISCOUNT_PERCENT$% off any single item over $COUPON_THRESHOLD_PRICE$ and a store credit of $CREDIT_PER_BEANS$ for every $BEANS_FOR_CREDIT$ beans in the coffee bag, which contained $TOTAL_BEANS$ beans. After she finally paid the discounted price, the cashier’s computer froze for a full $FREEZE_TIME_MINUTES$ minute(s), forcing them both to wait in awkward silence. How many times did the woman hear the word \"Ma'am\"?",
