  "problem": "At a community fundraiser with over $ATTENDEES$ attendees, Mrs. Edna was in charge of collecting $INITIAL_VOUCHER_COUNT$ special donation vouchers, each worth a value of $VOUCHER_VALUE$. The event's ambitious goal was to raise over one million dollars for a new town hall, and the entire fundraiser was scheduled to last exactly $FUNDRAISER_DURATION$ minutes. Before finding the manager to turn them in, she stopped at the snack table to buy a $PIE_COST$ pie for her grandson, Chad. The busy cashier accepted $VOUCHERS_USED$ of her donation vouchers to cover the cost of the pie and gave her $CHANGE_RECEIVED$ back in change. What was the total monetary value of the vouchers Edna was able to give to the fundraiser manager?",
