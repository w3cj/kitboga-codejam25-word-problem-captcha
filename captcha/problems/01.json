  "problem": "Edna, famous for her meticulous \"Wait-a-Minute\" cookies, is sourcing ingredients for a large charity bake sale and has determined she needs exactly $TOTAL_BEANS_NEEDED$ special vanilla beans. Old Jebediah once mentioned his extravagant recipes used $JEBEDIAH_BEAN_COUNT$ beans per batch, but Edna is sticking to her known quantities. Her resourceful friend Bernice found a supplier selling these beans in packs of $PACK_SIZE$ each, with each pack costing $PACK_PRICE$. Because it's for charity, the supplier, a real angel, offered Edna a $DISCOUNT_PER_PACK$ discount on every full pack she purchases. If the store has $STORE_STOCK_PACKS$ packs and Nevaeh is busy planning the event's social media outreach with $NEVAEH_POST_COUNT$ posts, what will be Edna's total cost for the vanilla beans after applying her discount, assuming she only buys the necessary number of full packs?",
