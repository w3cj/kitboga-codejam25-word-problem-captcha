  "problem": "Viktor, a meticulous security archivist, was tasked with digitally scanning historical records from a vault containing over one million documents. To begin his work each morning, he had to connect to a secure server, a process that involved a mandatory $HANDSHAKE_DURATION_SECONDS$-second security handshake. Each successful connection allowed him to scan a batch of exactly $RECORDS_PER_BATCH$ records before the system automatically logged him out. His department had a strict policy: for every failed connection attempt, a penalty of $PENALTY_FEE$ would be deducted from his project's budget of $PROJECT_BUDGET$. On Tuesday, he had a perfect day with no failed connections, managing to scan a total of $TOTAL_RECORDS_SCANNED$ records by the afternoon. What was the total time he spent waiting for the security handshakes to complete that day?",
