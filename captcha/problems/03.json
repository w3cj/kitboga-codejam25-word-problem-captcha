  "problem": "Richard is in charge of filling the plant's massive Steam Reservoir, which has a capacity of over one million gallons and powers the main generator. At the start of his shift, an automated system deposited $INITIAL_WATER$ gallons of purified water into the reservoir. His job is to confirm receipt of the water by running a series of $NUMBER_OF_CHECKS$ diagnostic checks on the system's virtual control panel. However, a known system glitch causes a loss of $LOSS_PER_CHECK$ gallons of water from the reservoir every time he completes a diagnostic check. His supervisor, Kyle, also warned him that any system errors logged during the checks would result in a $FINE_AMOUNT$ fine from the main office. The entire process, from the initial deposit to the final check, took him exactly $PROCESS_DURATION$ minutes to complete. How many gallons of water were left in the Steam Reservoir after he finished all his checks?",
