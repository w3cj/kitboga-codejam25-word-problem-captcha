  "problem": "Nevaeh was baking a complex $NUM_LAYERS$-layer birthday cake for her brother, Chad, a task she estimated would take $TOTAL_ESTIMATED_TIME$ minutes from start to finish. Her parrot, who loves shiny objects, perfectly mimics the sound of the microwave timer, which she set to go off every $TIMER_INTERVAL$ minutes to remind her to check the oven temperature. After working for exactly $TIME_WORKED$ minutes, she received a text message and completely forgot about the cake, leaving the kitchen to watch videos on her phone. The recipe called for exactly $SPRINKLES_COUNT$ sprinkles for decoration and $CUPS_OF_FLOUR$ cups of flour. Based on the time she was actually in the kitchen, how many times did she hear the parrot mimic the timer?",
