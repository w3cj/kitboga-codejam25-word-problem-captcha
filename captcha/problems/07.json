  "problem": "A meticulous old farmer has a new system for sorting his harvested corn cobs into $NUM_BINS$ bins: \"Prime\" and \"Feed.\" His manager insists that for every $PRIME_COBS_PER_TRIP$ \"Prime\" cobs he sorts, he must immediately pause his work, walk a $TRIP_DURATION_SECONDS$-second round trip to the barn office, and redeem a work voucher. The system is very strict; if he happens to sort a lower-quality \"Feed\" cob while he has an un-redeemed voucher in his pocket, he is penalized $PENALTY_COBS$ cobs from his \"Prime\" count. On Tuesday morning, the farmer began sorting a large crate and found that the first $TOTAL_PRIME_COBS_SORTED$ cobs he picked were all \"Prime\" quality, but the $FEED_COB_POSITION$th cob was for \"Feed.\" How many successful trips to the barn office did the farmer make that morning?",
